COURSE PROJECTS


Sarcasm Detection
Course Natural Language Processing

The goal of this hands-on project is to analyse the headlines of the articles from news sources and detect whether they are sarcastic or not.

Skills and Tools

GloVe, Classication, LSTM



Sentiment Analysis
Course Natural Language Processing

The objective of this project is to build a text classification model that analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the customers

Skills and Tools

RNN Word embedding LSTM Classification



Face Recognition
Course Computer Vision

Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

Skills and Tools

Computer Vision, Keras, CNN, Siamese Networks, Triplet loss



Face mask segmentation
Course Computer Vision

Predict and apply masks over the faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and apply a segmentation mask on the face.

Skills and Tools

Computer Vision, CNN, Transfer Learning, Object detection



Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers
Course Introduction to Neural Network and Deep Learning

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.

Skills and Tools

Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition



Product Recommendation Systems
Course Recommendation Systems

This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.

Skills and Tools

Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, Python



Predicting the Strength of high performance concrete
Course Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Skills and Tools

Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering


Classifying silhouettes of vehicles
Course Unsupervised Learning

Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.

Skills and Tools

Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification



Predicting the term-deposit subscription
Course Ensemble Techniques

Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest were used to further improve the classification results.

Skills and Tools

Classification, Decision Tress, Ensemble Techniques



Identifying potential customers for loans
Course Supervised Learning

Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

Skills and Tools

Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification



Health Insurance
Course Applied Statistics

This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

Skills and Tools

Hypothesis Testing, Data visualisation, statistical Inference
